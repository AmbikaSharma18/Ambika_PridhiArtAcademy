                region of the Indian subcontinent. This painting is done with a variety of tools,
                including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks and using natural dyes and
                pigments. It is characterised by its eye-catching geometrical patterns.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The Zentangle Method is an easy-to-learn, relaxing, and fun way to
                create beautiful images by drawing structured patterns. We call these patterns, tangles.
                You create tangles with combinations of dots, lines, simple curves, S-curves and orbs.
                These simple shapes are the "Elemental Strokes" in all Zentangle art.</p>

                notes down his preliminary ideas for a work that will eventually be realized with

                may have artistic merit.</p>
